module: mqtt
short_description: Publish a message on an MQTT topic for the IoT
version_added: "1.2"
description:
   - Publish a message on an MQTT topic.
options:
  server:
    description:
      - MQTT broker address/name
    required: false
    default: localhost
  port:
    description:
      - MQTT broker port number
    required: false
    default: 1883
  username:
    description:
      - Username to authenticate against the broker.
    required: false
  password:
    description:
      - Password for C(username) to authenticate against the broker.
    required: false
  client_id:
    description:
      - MQTT client identifier
    required: false
    default: hostname + pid
  topic:
    description:
      - MQTT topic name
    required: true
    default: null
  payload:
    description:
      - Payload. The special string C("None") may be used to send a NULL
        (i.e. empty) payload which is useful to simply notify with the I(topic)
        or to clear previously retained messages.
    required: true
    default: null
  qos:
    description:
      - QoS (Quality of Service)
    required: false
    default: 0
    choices: [ "0", "1", "2" ]
  retain:
    description:
      - Setting this flag causes the broker to retain (i.e. keep) the message so that
        applications that subsequently subscribe to the topic can received the last
        retained message immediately.
    required: false
    default: False

# informational: requirements for nodes
requirements: [ mosquitto ]
notes:
 - This module requires a connection to an MQTT broker such as Mosquitto
   U(http://mosquitto.org) and the C(mosquitto) Python module (U(http://mosquitto.org/python)).
